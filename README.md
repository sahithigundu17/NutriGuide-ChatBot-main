# NutriGuide-ChatBot
NutriGuide is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide personalized nutrition advice and meal recommendations. Built using Python, the chatbot leverages artificial intelligence to analyze users' dietary preferences, health goals, and lifestyle habits, offering tailored suggestions to help them maintain a healthy diet.


I've built a robust PDF-based document query system where users can upload PDFs, and the system will process them, split the content into smaller chunks, generate embeddings, and store them in an in-memory vector database. This enables a chatbot, powered by the Mistral 7B LLM, to intelligently respond to user queries by referencing the contents of the uploaded documents.

My project effectively combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), document management, and efficient information retrieval, allowing for an interactive and document-aware chatbot experience.
